1) Requirements Specification
    An app that shows an inventory of videogames alongside their cover art and several checkboxes
    The checkboxes will indicate if the game is owned, played, finished, completed, etc.
    Clicking on the game takes user into a new activity with more information on the game, including
    an option to rate the game.
    User is awarded with some sort of medal or something for different tiers of completion in games
    There can also be a screen to show statistics
    There should be a button somewhere to add new games to the database
